# My First ever proper programming/game dev project

Chase Runner is a 2D side-scrolling infinite runner game built natively using Java and Android Canvas. Developed as part of a club induction process, the game implements basic physics, object interactions, and sprite animations without relying on any external game engines.

## Features

* Native Android implementation using `Canvas`
* Gravity and jump mechanics modeled with projectile motion
* Obstacle generation and collision detection
* Power-up logic with state-based effect management
* Basic sprite-based animation system (manual frame handling)
* Dynamic scoring and chase logic
* Retrofit-based API integration for splash screen tips

## Tech Stack

* Java (Core game logic)
* Android XML (Layout)
* Android Canvas (Rendering)
* Retrofit (API integration)

## Project Timeline

* **Duration**: June 2023 â€“ July 2023
* **Context**: Built independently during the first year of college for a club task submission

## Setup Instructions
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChaseRunner.git
   ```
3. Open the project in Android Studio
4. Connect an emulator or Android device
5. Build and run

## Limitations

* Minimal animation due to lack of proper sprite assets
* Hardcoded frame timing
* No formal game state or pause/resume handling
